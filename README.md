# SyncBeat
Create your own sound from movements captured by your computer's camera or through drawings on your tablet. Each gesture or stroke becomes music, bringing your creativity to life in sound, whether it's realistic or abstract.

## Problem
Musical and artistic creation requires specific technical skills or relies heavily on visual interfaces. These skills make it difficult for many people, particularly children, people with visual impairments and individuals who have no artistic or musical training, to access the experience of creating and expressing themselves freely. In addition, there are very few digital tools that combine movement, drawing and sound in an intuitive, accessible and sensorially rich way.

## Solution
As a solution, an interactive application was developed that transforms body movements and hand-drawn pictures into music in real time. Using a computer or tablet camera, the user can move or draw freely and the application converts these gestures into soundscapes, musical notes and dynamic compositions.
This solution is highly inclusive with a focus on accessibility for people who are blind or have low vision, through sound feedback and voice guidance. The application offers a new form of creative, playful and educational expression that can be used by artists, schools, therapists and anyone interested in exploring the connection between body, sound and image.
